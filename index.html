            <p>A new virus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 )has
                 been  identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that began in China in 2019. 
                The disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
                The virus is a type of coronavirus — a family of viruses that can cause
                 illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
                 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).</p>

    <h2>How dose COVID-19 spread?</h2>
    <p>
        The new coronavirus appears to spread from person to person among those in close contact.
         It is spread by respiratory droplets when someone infected with 
         the virus coughs or sneezes. It's unclear exactly how contagious the virus is.

    <h2>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</h2>
    <p>
        According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment.

About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.

In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:
<span>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back
a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly</span>

As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.

    <h2>Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?</h2>
    <p>
        We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in, but estimates of the mortality rate have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.

        Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important.
